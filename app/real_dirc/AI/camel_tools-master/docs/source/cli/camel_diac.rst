Usage
-----

Below is the usage information that can be generated by running
``camel_diac --help``.

.. code-block:: none

   Usage:
       camel_diac [-d DATABASE | --db=DATABASE]
                  [-m MARKER | --marker=MARKER]
                  [-I | --ignore-markers]
                  [-S | --strip-markers]
                  [-p | --pretokenized]
                  [-o OUTPUT | --output=OUTPUT] [FILE]
       camel_diac (-l | --list-schemes)
       camel_diac (-v | --version)
       camel_diac (-h | --help)
   
   Options:
     -d DATABASE --db=DATABASE
           Morphology database to use. DATABASE could be the name of a builtin
           database or a path to a database file. [default: calima-msa-r13]
     -o OUTPUT --output=OUTPUT
           Output file. If not specified, output will be printed to stdout.
     -m MARKER --marker=MARKER
           Marker used to prefix tokens not to be transliterated.
           [default: @@IGNORE@@]
     -I --ignore-markers
           Transliterate marked words as well.
     -S --strip-markers
           Remove markers in output.
     -p --pretokenized
           Input is already pre-tokenized by punctuation. When this is set,
           camel_diac will not split tokens by punctuation but any tokens that
           do contain punctuation will not be diacritized.
     -l --list
           Show a list of morphological databases.
     -h --help
           Show this screen.
     -v --version
           Show version.


Databases
---------

We provide builtin databases to be able to run ``camel_diac`` out of the box
that can be passed to ``-d`` or ``--db``.
A list of available databases can be found at :ref:`camel_morphology_dbs`.

You can always check what builtin databases are provided in your current
``camel_tools`` installation by running ``camel_diac --list``.
Alternatively, you can pass in a path to a database of your chosing instead of
one of the above listed databases.

If no database is specified, **calima-msa-r13** is used.


Notes on markers
----------------

A marker a string with no whitespace characters at the beginning, middle, or
end of it (in otherwords, it's a single token without padding spaces). As a
rule-of-thumb pick a marker that is not-likely to appear in your text. We
use ``@@IGNORE@@`` as a default value, while some Arabic NLP tools use
``@@LAT@@`` to denote latin/foreign text.
